# WIP - unrealised value
- WIP (work in progress) is not value until its shipped
- The more you build up:
  - the more 'leverage your investment'
  - the less learning you do
  - the harder it is to reason about
    - for you
    - for your users
    - for the business
  - the worse you feel

---
# the importance of flow

- Frequent delivery of incremental value.
- If you can ship meaningful value frequently:
  - the path to the customer is shorter
  - the more learning you do
  - the easier it is to reason about:
    - for you
    - for your users
    - for the business
  - the happier you feel

# small iterations

- keeping tickets small means:
  - you can reason about your code
  - you can test more easily
  - you can _ship_ more frequently
    - so you learn more frequently
    - so you can course correct and avoid waste

# work on the closest to shipping first

- in kanban, the workflow is modelled by columns (e.g. TODO, DOING, TEST, DONE)
  - in that setup, you would always work on a card in 'TEST' before one in 'DOING'
  - but we can still internalise this principle no matter what tool we're using
- always work on the work that is closest to the customer first
  - the goal is to deliver value the soonest, so always work on the work closest to shipping
  - prevents accumulation of WIP (i.e. don't start something new, finish something old!)

---
# surface blockers and handovers

- we need to make blockers and handovers visual and obvious
- we need to make the team feel the pain of being blocked
  - it's not necessarily the right move to 'work on something new' if you're blocked

---
# limit in-progress cards

- having techniques or processes to limit 'in progress' tickets can help the team avoid the anti-pattern of too much WIP
  - If you are using SCRUM, plan the sprint to have a limited amount of WIP
  - If using kanban, you can set WIP limits on the board and on specific columns.
  - More WIP does not equal more shipping!
  - Do less to do more.

# summary

- There are a number of factors in achieving flow.
- The team needs to buy-in to the right principles and behaviours.
- Once flow is achieved, the team will be happier and more productive.
- Don't work around blockers by starting something else - _they_ are actually what we should be solving for.
